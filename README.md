3dprints # A weekend web page to track print jobs for the 3d printer.

<h1>3D Prints</h1> - redone Mar 11 2025

<h2>Purpose</h2>

This website was made so that I could keep track of the many ideas I have wanted printed since I purchased a 3d printer that was worth a damn.  For the record, I did not want a 3d printer so I could spend my time trying to make my 3d printer work, but to actually create things.  Prints take time, like hours per print.  So I made a way to track what jobs I wanted done, and what were holdups for current jobs.  Furthermore, it  became necessary to see what my filament type usage was and lead times needed for ordering more filament so that I could reduce downtime waiting on those filaments in an effort to remove that as work stoppage.  Then it became necessary to see demand.  This website does this for my needs.  Yours may vary.

<h2>Todo</h2>
Since there is always work to do I have written it here.  In fact, I came here to see what I needed to work on today and found I needed to write the README.
