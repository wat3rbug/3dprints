3dprints # A weekend web page to track print jobs for the 3d printer/s.  Im wondering if I should abandon this page, now that a) I have mulitple printers, and b) I discovered Bambu Labs has a print management application that does what I need and then some.

<h1>3D Prints</h1> - A simple wish list print website.  It does roughly keep track of the spools I use, the ordering and order tracking and other bobs and bits.  A weekend project that occasionally gets a weekend update.  Not like the SNL weekend update.

<h2>Purpose</h2>

This website was made so that I could keep track of the many ideas I have wanted printed since I purchased a 3d printer that was worth a damn.  For the record, I did not want a 3d printer so I could spend my time trying to make my 3d printer work, but to actually create things.  Prints take time, like hours per print.  So I made a way to track what jobs I wanted done, and what were holdups for current jobs.  Furthermore, it  became necessary to see what my filament type usage was and lead times needed for ordering more filament so that I could reduce downtime waiting on those filaments in an effort to remove that as work stoppage.  Then it became necessary to see demand.  This website does this for my needs.  Yours may vary.

<h2>Todo</h2>
Since there is always work to do I have written it here.  In fact, I came here to see what I needed to work on today and found I needed to write the README.

1. Active Prints
<ul>
  <li>Make spools column show only the stuff that isn't used - done</li>
  <li>Add ability to add photo to the model input </li>
  <li>Make the action column smaller. - done</li>
  <li>Make active tab appear - Its an issue with a certain version of bootstrap? - done.</li>
  <li>Make the table scrollable with frozen headers. - done</li>
  <li>When adding comments, update the table</li>
</ul>
2. Spools
<ul>
  <li>Make scrollable purchased spools table with frozen headers. - done</li>
  <li>Make a graph of purchased scrolls by month. - done</li>
</ul>
3. Orders
<ul>
  <li> Make a table that shows arrival of orders and the percentage that arrival time is met.  (having problems with Amazon as of late) - done </li>
  <li>Add a small section in order history that has spool orders YTD Total for wider trends - done</li>
  <li>Make scrollable purchased spools table with frozen headers. - done</li>
</ul>
4. Printers
<ul>
  <li>Make new page with the printers, their specifications, and names - done</li>
  <li>Update database to include a printers table - done</li>
  <li>Update active prints page to allow a dropdown for the printers by name</li>
  <li>Include a printer status page on the printers page - done</li>
  <li>Update database to allow a printer status table - done</li>
  <li>A minor annoyance.  The tab navigation bar was static, so I made it somewhat dynamic.  The page name and the title of the tab are key/value pairs and is active based on what is requested.  Its simple, but it works for now. - done</li>
</ul>
